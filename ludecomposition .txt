LU decomposition to solve the problem to get the solution of the matrix 


 THE GIVEN CONDITION IS (IN PAPER):

 MATRIX(A) * WEIGHT OR VARIABLE REQUIRED(X)=Y
 THEREFORE A*X=Y

 after decomposition of matrix A=LU
 LU*X=Y
 since U*X=m
 Lm=Y

 in this way first we calculate the m after getting m reverse the process to find the solution i.e: values of X

 
 THE GIVEN CONDITION IS (IN CODE):
 we decomposed into the three parts P,L,U here P is the permutation (and swapping the rows to get the lower triangular values)

 after getting swapping get dot product  of p and L which is equals to l
 for getting the values of m and X

 for m:
    get dot product of inverse of l and y
    Lm=y
    move the L on on other side do inv L on both sides
    m=inv of L .dot(Y)
 for X:
    get dot product of inverse of u and m    
    UX=m
    move the U on on other side do inv U on both sides
    X=inv of U .dot(m)
